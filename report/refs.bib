    abstract = {A reversible programming language supports deterministic forward and backward computation. We formalize the programming language Janus and prove its reversibility. We provide a program inverter for the language and implement a self-interpreter that achieves deterministic forward and backward interpretation of Janus programs without using a computation history. As the self-interpreter is implemented in a reversible language, it is invertible using local program inversion. Many physical phenomena are reversible and we demonstrate the power of Janus by implementing a reversible program for discrete simulation of the Schr\"{o}dinger wave equation that can be inverted as well as run forward and backward.},
