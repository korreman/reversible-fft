The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a widely-used algorithm for approximating the
Fourier Transform of a function.
FFT and its derivatives have a variety of practical uses in
mathematics, physics, signal processing, and many related fields.
For example,
the related Discrete Cosine Transform is employed in common media compression formats such as
MP3, JPEG, and MP4.

Especially in the cases of compression and de-noising,
we are interested in utilizing both the forward and inverse versions of the transform.
FT is an injective function with a well-defined inverse transformation (IFT),
but designing an approximation that retains this property presents some challenges.

In this report,
a reversible Fast Fourier Transform algorithm is presented
that can be directly implemented in a reversible language.
The ability to implement the algorithm in such a language can serve as proof of injectiveness.
Furthermore, deriving the inverse transform from the forward transform can ensure
that there are zero discrepancies between the two.
