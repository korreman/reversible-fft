\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we have explored the Fourier Transform and its discrete fixed-time cousin,
Discrete Fourier Transform.
We have seen how the DFT sum can be factorized into a recursive formulation,
allowing us to develop an $O(N \log N)$-time algorithm for computing this,
called the Fast Fourier Transform.
We have shown how, using even-odd scrambling, fixpoint arithmetic,
and lifting scheme, the FFT can be computed in-place and reversibly.
Finally, we have implemented this FFT in the reversible programming language Janus,
demonstrating that our algorithm is reversible in theory \textit{and} in practice.

Further work might explore the challenge of improving the algorithm to be bijective,
rather than only injective, potentially at the cost of some precision/correctness.
